Abstract:
In the current era of digital transformation and the thriving e-commerce landscape, the automotive industry has undergone significant advancements. These range from the integration of smart technologies into vehicles to the convenience of online car sales. However, a conspicuous gap remains, affecting both individual vehicle owners and the operations of automotive businesses. This gap involves the absence of a dedicated platform where consumers and professionals can easily and comprehensively compare the prices of car spare parts and equipment. Despite appearing minor, this deficiency poses a substantial challenge, leaving automotive enthusiasts and industry experts without a robust tool for making well-informed, cost-effective decisions in a market filled with diverse options and price disparities.
